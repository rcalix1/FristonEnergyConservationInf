## Uncertainty Minimization

*  active inference
*  brain mapping + neuroimaging analysis methods
*  SPM + DCM
*  Gaussian Random Field theory
*  "active inference" - a theory of how brains work - which is somewhat related to Reinforcement Learning (RL)
*  Free Energy Principle (FEP) which describes how systems (biological or artificial) minimize uncertainty about their environment by inferring the causes of sensory inputs + acting to fulfil their prior beliefs or reduce uncertainty.
*  Agents (such as humans) try to minimize "variational free energy", actively measuring the difference between their brain's model of the world + its sensory experiences.  ðŸ’¡
*  active inference and reinforcement learning aren't completely similar: RL maximises an external reward signal, but active Inference minimises a combination of "surprise "(discrepancy between observations + expectations) + uncertainty (lack of confidence in beliefs) but also (2) creates a generative model of the environment that predicts sensory inputs, given internal states.
*  Presumably AI people are not incorporating intrinsic motivation into their algorithms
